Parameters required for task 3.

The only parameter required for the model of the mathematical pendulum of task 
3 is the distance l of the center of mass of the smartphone from the pivotal 
point of the pendulum. It is a derived quantity, since it implies knowledge of 
the center of mass of the smartphone, but its derivation is not too evolved. 
The value of l is given in SI units
